# object-relational-mapping (E-commerce backend)

## Description
This is an app that organizes information in the e-commerce world. It stores product names, tags, and category information into a database.
As the user enters data into the system it will pull and organize product information in a backend database

## Usage
This is a fully backend project, so to use ot test this, it should be used with a program like Insomnia.
We will use the endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to view the data
It is a good idea to have a .env file with your username and password so that your credentials are not hardcoded; also it should be DB_NAME='ecommerce-db'
